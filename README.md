## Project Structure

### `tutorials/` — General Skill Building
Technique- and UI-focused walkthroughs that teach fundamental skills, independent of any specific dataset.

Each tutorial includes its own lightweight `environment.yml`.

### `case_studies/` — Biological Analysis Modules
Full biological workflows built around real datasets and scientific objectives.

Each case study provides:
- A more complete `environment.yml`  
- A detailed README  
- Domain-specific notebooks
